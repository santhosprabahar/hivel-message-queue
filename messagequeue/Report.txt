Design:
1.This application uses spring cloud stream framework which helps create event-driven microservices fast and easy.

3.The switching of message queue can be done just by making changes in binder properties of the configuration file.

Challenges:
1. Using the right binding and binder properties from spring cloud stream reference document deemed to be a challenge

Trade-offs:
